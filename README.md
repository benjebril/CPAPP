# Prework - *NeighborNet*

Submitted by: **Bennett Jebril**

**NeighborNet** is an app that could serve as a hyper-local social network, connecting neighbors for various purposes like borrowing tools for example. And slowly but surely it could expand outward, so maybe a suburb, then a city, then a state, country and so on and so forth. [TODO] 

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Twitter, Snapchat, Tiktok
I like Twitter because of the interconnectedness of everybody and that when you refresh you can see the latest things that happened pertaining to a certain topic. Snapchat allows me to view hotspots of different locations around the globe, and the ability to send your friends pictures. Tiktok is enjoyable because of the for you page and the ability of the app to develop an algorithim of content catered for you.


## Notes

The challenges that I encountered was locating some of the features within XCode. Other than that the prework was pretty smooth.
